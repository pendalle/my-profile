    		<h2>Job & Internship</h2>
    			<p>
    				I had the opportunity to take various student job.
    			</p>
          <p>
            In 2016 I've spent two weeks in internship, in a hotel. I was responsible of cleaning the rooms, preparing breakfast, receive the call of clients for booking, or checking if the price of the room was OK comparing to the marketprice. This experience was short but great!
          </p>
          <p>
            Since july 2019, I work, once a week in a market (at the stand fruits and vegetables). I help with customers service, installation, and cleaning of the stand.

    		<h2>Other experiences</h2>
    			<p>
    				In addition to my job and intership, I've done other things that helped me a lot and made me grow.
    			</p>
          <p>
            Since I'm little, i'm part of a scout group. Two years ago, I've become a chief of a groupe of little boys (8 to 12 years old). I love to spend sunday with them, playing and creating games. This experience has taught me creativity and organisation.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love to travel and discover new things. My last big trip was in New York during summer 2019. I had the opportunity to travel alone, without family or friends, during two weeks. This has taught me autonomy and I've enjoyed a lot this city. I would like to do the same this summer but in Rome, in Italy.

    		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
    			<p>
    				I like to read, watch movies, listen to music. To give an example, my favourite book is "La part de l'autre" of Eric Emmanuel Schmitt (a story about how Hitler was, and how he could have been) and my favourite TV Show is "Dark" a german Tv Show (talking about science fiction and time travel).
    			</p>
          <p>
            I love to party, to go out with my friends. I'm quite sure I don't have to explain this part.
